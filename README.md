THE FINAL PRESENTATION
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Di0zUMpNN4UYAcL3mVYuZLKT6b2qB9s5IL1uhup7f4U/edit?usp=sharing


Your presentation should present ideas at a very high level, and should cover the following topics:
- Who is this presentation/project report for? - kevin
- What is the design problem being addressed here? - jeffery
- Who are you designing for, and what is the context of their activities? - kevin
- What are the main things you discovered in your user research? - sunah
- What were the major design decisions that you made? (i.e. what did you decide were must haves vs. should haves; how did you arrive at the final design ideas?) - tyler
- How do you justify your design decisions? - tyler
- What did you discover from your heuristic evaluation? - esther
- What did you discover from your user testing? - esther
- How would you address these in the next iteration of the design? 

You should organize your final report with the following headings (roughly):
- Executive Summary
- Introduction - kevin
- Design Problem - jeffery
- User Research and Findings - sunah
- Design and Justification - tyler
- Heuristic Evaluation and Findings - esther
- User Testing and Findings - esther
- Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design - all
- Conclusions

2. List of stakeholders and describe them. (Due: Feb. 16) (Sunah)

3. Two user research methods used, justification for them, summary of findings from each of the methods. (Jeffrey)
   - (Survey Due: Feb. 12)
   - (Character Profile Due: Feb. 15)
   
4. Reflect on the use of the methods; what went well, what went poorly, what you would do differently. (Due: Feb. 16) (Everyone)

5. Six to Eight task descriptions (Due: Feb. 16) (Esther, Tyler)

- Front Page
	- Login + Register
	
- Create Profile page
	- If register
	- maybe same as edit profile

- Profile Page
	- Border
	- Background
	- Bio
	- Album
	- Games played
	- Edit (yours)
	- requesst / (message) (theirs)
	

- Graph
-	MAtches
	-	Hovering brings up profile summary
		-	Has profile pic
		-	Bio
		-	message
	-	Circle with profile pic
		-	smaller circles games played
	-	Summary -> Profile
-	Another graph with genre in the center
	-	Genre/Filter
	-	Side arrow tab pop up thing
-	Main graph
	-	Profile in center
	-	Matches attacached as branches
		-	further out are not as close as matches
		-	matches based on games + other stuff
	-	outer circle has games floating around
		-	based on our algorithm
		-	drag onto graph
		-		a) Makes a new branch
						

- Request Page
	- If we have this page we should probably put the chat here too
	
- Chat bubbles at bottom
	- When clicked goes to the location of the person on the graph

- Help & Documentation
